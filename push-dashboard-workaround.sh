REGISTRY="docker.reactmotion.com"
REPO="my-docker-repo"

echo "Current Status:"
echo "✅ API image: Successfully pushed (1.86GB)"
echo "✅ Worker image: Successfully pushed (1.77GB)" 
echo "❌ Dashboard image: Failed on 313MB .yarn cache layer"
echo

echo "The dashboard image exists locally as:"
echo "  docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:multitenancy-redis-v1"
echo

echo "Workaround Options:"
echo
echo "1. Use a faster internet connection (recommended)"
echo "   - The 313MB layer is too large for reliable upload at 50 Mb/s"
echo "   - Consider uploading from a server with better connectivity"
echo
echo "2. Save and transfer the image manually:"
echo "   docker save docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:multitenancy-redis-v1 | gzip > dashboard.tar.gz"
echo "   # Transfer dashboard.tar.gz to a server with better connectivity"
echo "   # On the server: docker load < dashboard.tar.gz"
echo "   # Then push from there"
echo
echo "3. For now, you can deploy with just API and Worker services"
echo "   - Update docker-compose.yaml to comment out the dashboard service temporarily"
echo "   - The API and Worker are the core services and will function without the dashboard"
echo
echo "Registry Status:"
echo "- API: ${REGISTRY}/${REPO}/dittofeed/api:multitenancy-redis-v1 ✅"
echo "- API: ${REGISTRY}/${REPO}/dittofeed/api:latest ✅"
echo "- Worker: ${REGISTRY}/${REPO}/dittofeed/worker:multitenancy-redis-v1 ✅"
echo "- Worker: ${REGISTRY}/${REPO}/dittofeed/worker:latest ✅"
echo "- Dashboard: Not pushed (local only) ❌"

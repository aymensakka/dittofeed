- create a new script in `packages/admin-cli/src/commandDefinitions.ts`
- it should be called `export-user-events`
- it should copy user events from the dittofeed.user_events_v2 table in a source clickhouse instance to a destination clickhouse instance.
- see `packages/backend-lib/src/userEvents/clickhouse.ts` for a reference table implementation.
- it should have several options:
    - source-clickhouse-host
    - source-clickhouse-port
    - source-clickhouse-database
    - source-clickhouse-user
    - source-clickhouse-password
    - destination-clickhouse-host
    - destination-clickhouse-port
    - destination-clickhouse-database
    - destination-clickhouse-user
    - destination-clickhouse-password
    - batch-size: the number of events to copy at a time (clickhouse performs poorly when doing frequent small inserts, and performs better when doing large batch inserts).

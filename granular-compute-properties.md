# Granular Compute Properties

Dittofeed is an open-source customer engagement platform. We have different types of "resources", among which are:

- Segments: Process user events to assign a boolean value to a user, determining if they belong to a segment.
- User properties: Process user events to assign a JSON string value to a user, used to render dynamic content in messages.
- Journeys: Process user events to send messages to users.
- Integrations: Process user events send events and resource assignment values to external services.

Resources exist within a "workspace", which is our concept of a customer or tenant.

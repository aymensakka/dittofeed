- Amend the /upload-csv endpoint in packages/api/src/controllers/subscriptionGroupsController.ts so that the csv takes an "action" column, and the value of the column is either "subscribe" or "unsubscribe".
- If the column doesn't exist, assume all users are subscribed.
- If a column value is an empty string, null, or undefined, assume the user is subscribed.
- If the column contains a non-empty string that is neither "subscribe" nor "unsubscribe", return a 400 error.
- Document the structure of the csv in the subscription groups docs packages/docs/resources/subscription-groups.mdx
- Create a new sample upload csv file for local development in packages/dashboard/sample-uploads/

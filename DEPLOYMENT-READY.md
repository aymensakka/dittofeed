# ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Ready - All Images in Nexus Registry

## Success Summary

All Docker images have been successfully pushed to the Nexus registry at `docker.reactmotion.com`.

### Available Images

#### API Service
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/api:multitenancy-redis-v1`
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/api:latest`

#### Worker Service
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/worker:multitenancy-redis-v1`
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/worker:latest`

#### Dashboard Service
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:multitenancy-redis-v1`
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:latest`

## Key Solution

The dashboard push succeeded by configuring Docker to use single-threaded uploads:
```json
{
  "max-concurrent-uploads": 1,
  "max-concurrent-downloads": 1
}
```

This prevented the 313MB .yarn cache layer from timing out on the 50 Mb/s connection.

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Configure Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file contains:
```bash
DOCKER_REGISTRY_USERNAME=coolify-system
DOCKER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=9sFPGGDJUFnE4z*z4Aj9
```

### 2. Deploy with Docker Compose

Use the full `docker-compose.yaml` file:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. In Coolify

1. Use the `docker-compose.yaml` file (not the no-dashboard version)
2. Ensure Docker registry credentials are configured
3. Deploy the stack

# Nexus Docker Registry Push Summary

## ✅ Successfully Pushed Images

The following images have been successfully pushed to `docker.reactmotion.com`:

### API Service
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/api:multitenancy-redis-v1` ✅
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/api:latest` ✅
- Size: 1.86GB
- Push Duration: 48 seconds

### Worker Service
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/worker:multitenancy-redis-v1` ✅
- `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/worker:latest` ✅
- Size: 1.77GB
- Push Duration: 54 seconds (after 2 attempts)

## ❌ Dashboard Image Status

The dashboard image could not be pushed due to network limitations:

- **Image**: `docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:multitenancy-redis-v1`
- **Size**: 1.24GB
- **Issue**: Consistently fails on layer `e473935e4567` (313MB .yarn cache)
- **Error**: 499 status code (client timeout)
- **Root Cause**: 50 Mb/s connection insufficient for 313MB layer

## Workaround Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy Without Dashboard (Recommended for Now)
Update your `docker-compose.yaml` to comment out the dashboard service:
```yaml
#  dashboard:
#    image: docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:multitenancy-redis-v1
#    # ... rest of dashboard configuration
```

The API and Worker services are fully functional and can operate independently.

### Option 2: Manual Transfer
1. Save the image locally:
   ```bash
   docker save docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:multitenancy-redis-v1 | gzip > dashboard.tar.gz
   ```
2. Transfer `dashboard.tar.gz` to a server with better connectivity
3. Load and push from there:
   ```bash
   docker load < dashboard.tar.gz
   docker push docker.reactmotion.com/my-docker-repo/dittofeed/dashboard:multitenancy-redis-v1
   ```

### Option 3: Use Faster Connection
- The 313MB layer requires a more stable/faster connection
- Consider uploading from a cloud server or office connection

## Deployment Ready

Despite the dashboard push failure, you can proceed with deployment:

1. **Core Services Available**: API and Worker images are in the registry
2. **Local Dashboard**: The dashboard image exists locally and works
3. **Coolify Deployment**: Can deploy API and Worker services now

## Push Scripts Created

The following scripts were created to help with pushing:
- `push-to-nexus.sh` - Pushes all images sequentially
- `push-single-image.sh` - Push one image at a time
- `push-with-retry.sh` - Automatic retry logic for failures
- `push-slow-connection.sh` - Optimized for slow connections

## Registry Authentication

Successfully configured and tested authentication:
- Registry: `docker.reactmotion.com`
- Repository: `my-docker-repo`
- Authentication: ✅ Working

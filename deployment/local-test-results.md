# Local Deployment Test Results

## Summary
✅ **Successfully reproduced production issues locally**

## Test Environment
- **Platform**: macOS (Apple Silicon)
- **Docker**: Desktop
- **Images**: Built from source
- **Ports**: PostgreSQL on 5433, Redis on 6379, API on 3001, Dashboard on 3000

## Issues Reproduced

### 1. Database Not Initialized ❌
**Status**: Confirmed - Same as production
```sql
postgres=# \dt
Did not find any relations.
```

**Evidence**:
- No tables created in PostgreSQL
- Bootstrap environment variables set but not executing
- API starts but doesn't run migrations

### 2. API Empty Version ❌
**Status**: Confirmed - Same as production
```json
{
  "version": ""
}
```

**Evidence**:
- API responds on port 3001
- Returns empty version string
- Minimal logging output

### 3. Dashboard Issues ⚠️
**Status**: Partially working
- Dashboard starts on port 3000
- Redirects from / to /dashboard
- Shows deprecation warnings for zustand

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Bootstrap Not Executing

The bootstrap process is not running despite environment variables being set:
```
BOOTSTRAP=true
BOOTSTRAP_SAFE=true
BOOTSTRAP_WORKSPACE_NAME=LocalWorkspace
```

**Possible Causes**:
1. Missing migration files in production image
2. Bootstrap code not being called from startServer.js
3. Configuration validation failing silently
4. Missing ClickHouse configuration blocking startup

### Secondary Issues:
1. Missing required configuration (ClickHouse)
2. No error logging for failed bootstrap
3. Silent failures in initialization

## Next Steps

### Immediate Fix Needed:
1. Manual database initialization script
2. Include migration files in Docker image
3. Add bootstrap execution verification

### Investigation Required:
1. Check if migration files exist in container
2. Verify bootstrap code execution path
3. Add debug logging to startup process

## Working Components
- ✅ Docker images build successfully
- ✅ PostgreSQL starts and is accessible
- ✅ Redis starts and is accessible
- ✅ API server starts and responds
- ✅ Dashboard server starts
- ✅ Network connectivity between services

## Non-Working Components
- ❌ Database schema creation
- ❌ Bootstrap process
- ❌ Workspace initialization
- ❌ Version information
- ❌ Full dashboard functionality

## Conclusion

The local deployment successfully reproduces all production issues, confirming that the problem is in the application code/configuration, not the deployment platform (Coolify). The main issue is the bootstrap process not executing to create the database schema.

# Multi-Tenant Authentication Status

## Current Situation

The multi-tenant authentication is **NOT fully implemented** in the Dittofeed API codebase.

### What's Missing

1. **OAuth Routes**: The `/api/public/auth/oauth2/initiate/google` route doesn't exist
2. **Multi-tenant Auth Controller**: Only single-tenant auth controller exists
3. **Route Registration**: The router only registers auth routes when `authMode === "single-tenant"`

### Evidence

From `packages/api/src/buildApp/router.ts`:
```typescript
backendConfig().authMode === "single-tenant"
  ? f.register(authController, { prefix: "/single-tenant" })
  : null,
```

When `authMode` is `multi-tenant`, NO auth controller is registered.

### Why Dashboard Returns 404

1. Dashboard is correctly built for multi-tenant mode
2. Dashboard pages use `requestContext` which requires authentication
3. Without authentication, all pages return 404 (security feature)
4. BUT there's no way to authenticate because OAuth routes don't exist

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Use Single-Tenant Mode
- Set `AUTH_MODE=single-tenant` in all services
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODE=single-tenant` in dashboard
- Rebuild dashboard with single-tenant mode
- This will allow password-based authentication

### Option 2: Implement Multi-Tenant Auth
- Add OAuth controller for multi-tenant mode
- Implement `/api/public/auth/oauth2/initiate/google` route
- Add session management for multi-tenant
- This requires code changes to the API

### Option 3: Bypass Authentication (Development Only)
- Modify `requestContext` to skip auth checks
- NOT recommended for production
- Security risk

## Recommended Action

For immediate use, switch to **single-tenant mode**:

1. Update Coolify environment variables:
   - `AUTH_MODE=single-tenant`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_AUTH_MODE=single-tenant`

2. Rebuild dashboard:
   ```bash
   ./deployment/build-dashboard-single-tenant.sh
   ```

3. Redeploy in Coolify

4. Access dashboard at:
   ```
   https://communication-dashboard.caramelme.com/dashboard/auth/single-tenant
   ```

## Conclusion

The 404 errors are happening because:
- Dashboard expects multi-tenant auth
- API doesn't provide multi-tenant auth routes
- This is an incomplete feature in the codebase

The system is working as designed, but the multi-tenant auth feature is not fully implemented.

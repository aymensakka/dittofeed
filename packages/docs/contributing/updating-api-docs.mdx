title: Updating Dittofeed's API docs
---

Updating Dittofeed's API docs requires running Dittofeed's API server locally, and copying the OpenAPI / Swagger spec to the docs package.

First, start the API server:

```bash
yarn workspace api dev
```

Then, in a separate terminal, run the following command to copy the OpenAPI / Swagger spec to the docs package:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3001/documentation/json" | jq "." > packages/docs/open-api.json
```

Note this command assumes you have [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed, which formats the JSON output from the API server.

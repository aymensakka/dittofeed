title: Running Dittofeed Locally
---

To run Dittofeed locally, start docker compose, and then run the development bootstrap script.

```bash
docker compose --profile apps up -d
# The bootstrap script will run migrations and seed data stores with default
# resources.
./scripts/bootstrap-dev.sh
```

## Developing a Dittofeed Service

Dittofeed has three services.

1. Dashboard
2. API
3. Worker

If you want to run a particular application while making changes to it, you will
want to run that application in the foreground outside of docker compose.

### Dashboard

```bash
docker compose --profile apps-dashboard up -d
yarn workspace dashboard dev
```

### API

```bash
docker compose --profile apps-api up -d
yarn workspace api dev
```

### Worker

```bash
docker compose --profile apps-worker up -d
yarn workspace worker dev
```

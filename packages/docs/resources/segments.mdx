Segments are one of the most important Dittofeed resouces to understand. Segments are used to define a group of users. Segments serve multiple roles.

Segment uses:

- In [journey entry nodes](/resources/journey-nodes/entry) to determine which users enter a journey.
- In [journey segment split nodes](/resources/journey-nodes/segment-split) to direct users along a specific path within journeys.

Segments are defined by composing one or more segment nodes in a hierarchy.

Journeys are the basic building block for messaging automation in Dittofeed. You use them to configure who gets messaged when and with what.

At a minimum journeys contain an [entry node](/resources/journey-nodes/entry), and an [exit node](/resources/journey-nodes/entry).

By itself, this journey does nothing. That's where a message node comes in.

There are other journey nodes which are available, and we're adding more all of the time!

## Journey Nodes

- [Entry Node](/resources/journey-nodes/entry)
- [Message Node](/resources/journey-nodes/message)
- [Exit Node](/resources/journey-nodes/exit)
- [Delay Node](/resources/journey-nodes/delay)
- [Segment Split Node](/resources/journey-nodes/delay)

## Journey Status

Journeys can have one of the three following statuses

"Not Started" &rarr; "Running" &harr; "Paused".

Journeys begin as "Not Started", and can be started so that they're "Running", at which point they can be "Paused" and unpaused.

**Not Started**

Users cannot enter a journey until it is Running.

**Running**

Users who satisfy the entry node's segment can enter the journey. 

**Paused**

Additional users cannot enter a Paused journey. Useres already in the journey will progress through it as normal, up until the user would receive a message. At this point, if the journey has not been unpaused the message will be skipped and the user will prematurely exit the journey.

The dittofeed-ee application is a closed source extension of Dittofeed that includes additional features, like support for [multi-tenancy](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes/multi-tenant).

## Installation

To install dittofeed-ee, contact the Dittofeed team at [support@dittofeed.com](mailto:support@dittofeed.com) in order to receive a personal access token for our private docker image registry.

Once you have the token, you can install dittofeed-ee using our docker compose file or helm chart.

### Docker Compose

First, login to the docker registry using your Dittofeed issued personal access token.

```bash
docker login -u <username> -p <personal-access-token> 
```

Then, run our docker-compose.lite.yaml file with the repository set to `dittofeed/dittofeed-ee`.

```bash
IMAGE_TAG=v0.22.0-ee.1 IMAGE_REPOSITORY=dittofeed/dittofeed-ee docker-compose -f docker-compose.lite.yaml up -d
```

### Helm Chart

Likewise, you can install dittofeed-ee using our helm chart. First, login to the docker registry using your Dittofeed issued personal access token.

Then, install the helm chart.

```bash
helm install dittofeed dittofeed/dittofeed --set image.repository=dittofeed/dittofeed-ee --set image.tag=v0.22.0-ee.1
```

or set the repository in your values.yaml file.

```yaml

  repository: dittofeed/dittofeed-ee
  tag: v0.22.0-ee.1
```

title: `multi-tenant` Auth Mode
description: Enable multi-tenancy in your Dittofeed instance.
---

Multi-tenancy, facilitated by the `multi-tenant` "auth mode", allows you to run multiple Dittofeed workspaces on a single instance of Dittofeed. These workspaces allow you to isolate data for different customers, and can be managed programmatically.

It provides separate workspace member accounts, which can be configured with different permissions.

The `multi-tenant` auth mode is only available in dittofeed-ee, and Dittofeed cloud. See [dittofeed-ee](/docs/deployment/self-hosted/dittofeed-ee) for more information on installing dittofeed-ee.

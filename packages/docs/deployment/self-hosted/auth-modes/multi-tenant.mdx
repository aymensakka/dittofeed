title: `multi-tenant` Auth Mode
description: Enable multi-tenancy in your Dittofeed instance.
---

Multi-tenancy, facilitated by the `multi-tenant` "auth mode", allows you to run multiple Dittofeed workspaces on a single instance of Dittofeed. These workspaces allow you to isolate data for different customers, and can be managed programmatically.

It provides separate workspace member accounts, which can be configured with different permissions.

The `multi-tenant` auth mode is only available in dittofeed-ee, and Dittofeed cloud. See [dittofeed-ee](/docs/deployment/self-hosted/dittofeed-ee) for more information on installing dittofeed-ee.

## Setup

Multi-tenancy utilizes OIDC for authentication. To enable multi-tenancy, you will need to configure an OIDC provider.

### Auth0

In order to configure Auth0 as an OIDC provider for multi-tenancy, use the following environment variables.

```bash .env
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID='<your-auth0-client-id>'
OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET='<your-auth0-client-secret>'
SECRET_KEY='<your-secret-key>'
AUTH_MODE='multi-tenant'
AUTH_PROVIDER='auth0'
# example: https://my-dittofeed-instance.com/dashboard/signout
SIGNOUT_URL='https://<your-dittofeed-instance>/dashboard/signout'
```

#### Configuring Auth0

In auth0 create a Regular Web Application.

Then in the settings of the application, (https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard/us/dittofeed/applications/<application-id>/settings) take the following actions.

* Copy the `Client ID` which will be used as the `OPEN_ID_CLIENT_ID`.
* Copy the `Client Secret` which will be used as the `OPEN_ID_CLIENT_SECRET`.
* Add a callback URL of the form `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>/dashboard/oauth2/callback`.
* Add a `Logout URL` of the form `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>/dashboard/signout/complete`.
* Add an `Allowed Callback URLs` of the form `https://<your-dittofeed-instance>`.
* Allow Cross-Origin Authentication.
* Click Save Changes.


### Generating a Secret Key

See our documentation on [Authentication Modes](/deployment/self-hosted/auth-modes) for instructions on how to generate a new `SECRET_KEY`.

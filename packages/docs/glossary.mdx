## Action

A step in a messaging journey which carries out pre-defined work if its trigger is activated. Imagine a simple journey where a new user is messaged with a welcome email. The trigger is the new user being saved to your database, and the action is the welcome email being sent to the user.

## Campaign

An organized marketing effort to promote brand awareness or sell a product. Customer engagement platforms like Dittofeed are used to distribute high volumes of messages to users in ways which are consistent with campaign goals. For instance, Company X is launching a campaign around a new feature with the goal of converting free users to paid users. Company X knows that Demographic Y is most inclined to like the feature. So, the company builds a journey which segments users by demographic, and sends Demographic Y messages at regular time intervals with content about feature benefits and use cases.

## CDP

An acronym for “customer data platform”. CDPs are databases designed specifically to aid in crafting complete views of individual customers. They also provide simple ways to send and receive customer information to and from business intelligence tools and marketing software.

## Channel

A messaging outlet. Some commonly used channels include email, SMS, Slack, and in-app messaging. Customer engagement platforms which are "omni-channel" provide tools that allow messaging to be sent across all channels.

## Event

A discrete amount and type of user activity or inactivity within an application or on a website. A user placing items in a shopping cart and a user abandoning a cart can each be considered events.

## In-app Messaging

Messaging that happens within an application. SaaS companies will often deploy this type of messaging to remind users of features they aren’t using and to give them helpful advice on how to get the most out of the software.

## Integration

Interoperability between separate software systems.

## Journey

A sequence of triggers and actions which automate the process of sending well-timed, relevant messaging to users. Journeys (also known as workflows) allow companies to automatically split users into segments, add time delays to messages, send different messaging templates based on user behavior, and much more.

Journeys automate communicating with users about things like:

Onboarding  
Promotions  
Cart abandonment  
Loyalty programs  
Newsletters  
New feature rollout

## Reverse ETL

A method of operationalizing warehoused data by pushing it into business applications for analysis, reporting, customer engagement, and many other uses that benefit the business. "ETL" stands for "extract, transform, load”, and refers to the way in which reverse ETL software prepares warehoused data for it’s destination applications. Popular data warehouses include Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and Google BigQuery. Popular data destinations include Salesforce, Tableau, and Amplitude.

## Segment

A section of users defined by specific parameters like demography, app usage metrics, and message responses. Segmentation is the act of defining a segment by choosing the appropriate parameters for a business objective. For example, Company X has users across the world who use their app to varying degrees, but the company only wants to send a particular message to its North American users who don't use the app very often. Segmentation could be used to identify who those users are in order to send targeted messaging to them.

## Template

A standardized messaging layout, often with a visual design and variable input fields which can be programmatically altered to automate message personalization.

## Trigger

A switch that activates a journey action. Triggers are created by assigning events to them and placing them before a desired action within a journey. ”Event” and “trigger” are sometimes used interchangeably. However, events happen outside of a journey (on your app, website, etc.), while triggers happen within journeys. For example, a user clicks on a “buy” button on Company X’s website, and this click is saved as an event in the company’s database. The company then decides to create a journey to message every user who clicks on the “buy” button (the “event”), so they make a trigger that listens for this specific event and activates a “message send” action each time the event occurs.

## Webhook

A way for an application to stream data to outside applications without the need for those outside applications to make frequent API requests. Instead, the outside application builds an endpoint to receive the streamed data.

## Workflow

Another term for a journey. Workflows are sequences of triggers and actions.

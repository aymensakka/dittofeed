## Action

A step in a messaging journey that carries out pre-defined work if its trigger is activated. Imagine you have a simple journey where you want a new user to be messaged with a welcome email. The trigger is the new user being saved to your database, and the action is the welcome email being sent to the user.

## Campaign

An organized marketing effort to promote brand awareness or sell a product. Customer engagement platforms like Dittofeed are used to distribute high volumes of messages to users in ways which are consistent with campaign goals. For instance, Company X is launching a campaign around a new feature with the goal of converting free users to paid users. Company X knows that Demographic Y is most inclined to like the feature. So, the company builds a journey which segments users by demographic, and sends Demographic Y messages at regular time intervals with content about feature benefits and use cases.

## CDP

An acronym for “customer data platform”. CDPs are databases designed specifically to aid in crafting complete views of individual customers. They also provide simple ways to send and receive customer information to and from business intelligence tools and marketing software.

## Channel

A messaging outlet. Some commonly used channels include email, SMS, Slack, and in-app messaging. Customer engagement platforms which are "omni-channel" provide tools that allow messaging to be sent across all channels.

## Event

A discrete amount and type of user activity or inactivity within an application or on a website. A user placing items in a shopping cart and a user abandoning a cart can each be considered events.

## In-app Messaging

Messaging that happens within an application. SaaS companies will often deploy this type of messaging to remind users of features they aren’t using and to give them helpful advice on how to get the most out of the software.

## Integration

## Journey

A sequence of triggers and actions which automate the process of sending well-timed, relevant messaging to users. Journeys (also known as workflows) allow companies to automatically split users into segments, add time delays to messages, send different messaging templates based on user behavior, and much more.

Create journeys to automate messaging for things like:

User onboarding  
Promotions  
Cart abandonment  
Loyalty programs  
Newsletters  
New feature rollout

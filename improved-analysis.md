# Improved Analysis

## Problem Statement

We're building Dittofeed, an open-source customer engagement platform. It's an alternative to platforms like Braze, Customer.io, and Iterable.

I'm in the process of building a new analysis page for the dashboard. I'd like assistance with designing the page then implementing it. I'd like to implement a solution that provides most of the functionality available in other, equivalent applications.

# EFFICIENT MULTITENANCY ENHANCEMENT FOR DITTOFEED

> _Auto-generated from legacy docs in **/docs** + repo scan.  
> Fill in the "❗ Needs clarification" bullets before implementation._

## FEATURE OVERVIEW
- **Legacy Docs referenced**: [docs/official_documentation.md], [README.md]
- **High-Level Goal**: Enhance Dittofeed's existing multitenancy architecture for improved performance, security, and scalability
- **Key Capabilities**: 
  - Enhanced workspace isolation with row-level security
  - Optimized database queries with tenant-aware indexing
  - Advanced caching strategies per tenant
  - Resource quotas and tenant management
  - Improved connection pooling and query optimization
- **Tech Stack Snapshot**: TypeScript monorepo, Fastify 4.23.2, Next.js 14, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, Temporal.io

## GAPS & INCONSISTENCIES (auto-detected)
- ❗ GAP-001: Current workspace isolation lacks row-level security policies for defense-in-depth
- ❗ GAP-002: No tenant-specific query optimization indexes for large-scale performance
- ❗ GAP-003: Missing resource quota enforcement per workspace
- ❗ GAP-004: Connection pooling not optimized for multi-tenant workloads
- ❗ GAP-005: No tenant-aware caching strategy for computed properties
- ❗ GAP-006: Lack of tenant usage monitoring and analytics
- ❗ GAP-007: No tenant onboarding automation or lifecycle management

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] All gaps resolved or deferred with rationale
- [ ] Enhanced database performance with tenant-aware indexes
- [ ] Row-level security implemented for critical tables
- [ ] Tenant resource quotas and monitoring in place
- [ ] Optimized connection pooling for multi-tenant scenarios
- [ ] New unit & integration tests pass
- [ ] CI pipeline green
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show improvement
- [ ] Security audit passes for tenant isolation

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Current Multitenancy Foundation
- **Workspace-based isolation**: All major tables include `workspaceId` foreign keys
- **Hierarchical tenancy**: Parent-child workspace relationships supported
- **Authentication modes**: anonymous, single-tenant, multi-tenant
- **Request context**: Workspace resolution from headers, body, query params
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control with workspace member roles

### Enhancement Areas
1. **Database Layer**: Enhanced indexing, RLS, query optimization
2. **Application Layer**: Connection pooling, caching, resource management
3. **Security Layer**: Advanced authorization, encryption, audit trails
4. **Performance Layer**: Query optimization, background job efficiency
5. **Operational Layer**: Monitoring, alerting, tenant lifecycle management
